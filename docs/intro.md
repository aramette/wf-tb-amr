## Introduction

`wf-tb-amr` is a workflow for determining the antibiotic resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples. The 
workflow handles multiplexed sequencing runs and provides clear and simple reports summarising the 
predicted resistance profile of each sample according to genetic variants discovered.
